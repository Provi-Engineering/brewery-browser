### interviewer should explain:

- click run at the top
- svelte basics (most of this should be easy from looking at the code)
- how to run the specs (once the site has loaded, go to the `shell` to the right and run `npm run test`)
- the point of this is to demonstrate abilities, not get through the entire todo list
- here is the brewery api https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation#list-breweries

### exercises

- show some other brewery data besides the name
- create controls to paginate brewery data
- write tests for the new data and new controls
- change api fetch to use async await
- move api usage to a new file
- stub out the new file in the spec instead of stubbing out global fetch
- add some css to pretty up the place
- add typescript to the project (including updating the config)
- add search functionality to the app
